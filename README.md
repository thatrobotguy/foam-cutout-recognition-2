#What the heck is this?
This repository contains the scripts to create trainale data, train a network on the data, and then infer datatypes through the network.

The out directory actually comes out as "0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6" and it manually has to be set to "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5" by changing "4,5,6" to "3,4,5"
